# JS Assignment

1. Fill in the  function stub below. 
You can assume English words as
input, one at a time, no made-up stuff. Implementation must work in
Internet Explorer 6 and pass the tests following the stub.

    ```
    function isPalindrome (word) {
        ...your code here...
    }
    ```

    ```
    console.log (isPalindrome("anna") === true);
    console.log (isPalindrome("Anna") === true);
    console.log (isPalindrome("anna ") === true);
    console.log (isPalindrome("YellowSubmarine") === false);
    ```

2. Take the above and provide a front - end.

    2.1 create a table with three columns - sequence number, input word, expected result === actual result
    
    2.2 paint every cell of the last column green where expected result matches actual or red otherwise

    2.3 optional: create an interface to add and run new tests. Does not need to remember added tests.
